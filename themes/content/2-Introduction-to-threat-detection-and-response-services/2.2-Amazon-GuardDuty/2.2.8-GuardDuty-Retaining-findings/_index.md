GuardDuty retains the generated findings for a period of 90 days. GuardDuty exports the active findings to Amazon EventBridge. You can optionally export the generated findings to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. This will help you to track the historical data of potentially suspicious activities in your account and evaluate whether the recommended remediation steps were successful.

Any new active findings that GuardDuty generates are automatically exported within about 5 minutes after the finding is generated. You can set the frequency for how often updates to the active findings are exported to EventBridge. The frequency that you select applies to the exporting of new occurrences of existing findings to EventBridge, your S3 bucket (when configured), and Detective (when integrated).

When you configure settings to export findings to an Amazon S3 bucket, GuardDuty uses AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt the findings data in your S3 bucket. This requires you to add permissions to your S3 bucket and the AWS KMS key so that GuardDuty can use them to export findings in your account.
