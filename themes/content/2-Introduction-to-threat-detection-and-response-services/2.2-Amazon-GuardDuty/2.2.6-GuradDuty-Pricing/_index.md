#### GuardDuty - Pricing

1. The **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}** console displays the number of days remaining in your free trial, along with the average daily cost.  
   This estimate is calculated based on the volume of data analyzed and scanned, helping you better understand and plan for ongoing security costs.

2. From the GuardDuty console, open the **Usage** page by selecting **Settings** in the left navigation panel and then choosing **Usage**.

3. Review your current trial usage and the estimated cost.  
   Cost estimates shown in the GuardDuty console may differ slightly from those displayed in the **AWS Billing and Cost Management** console, as they are based on recent usage patterns and projected analysis volumes.
