#### Security Hub - Pricing

1. The GuardDuty console shows how many days remain in the free trial, along with the average daily cost based on the volume of data analyzed and scanned. This helps reduce uncertainty when planning budgets.

2. From Detective, open the **Usage** page using the navigation menu on the left under **Settings**.

3. Review your current trial usage and estimated cost. The estimates shown in the GuardDuty console may differ slightly from those in the AWS Billing and Cost Management console. For more details, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/monitoring_costs.html.
