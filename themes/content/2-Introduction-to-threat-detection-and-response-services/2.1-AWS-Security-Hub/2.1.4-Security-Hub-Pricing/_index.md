#### Security Hub - Pricing

1. During the free trial period, Security Hub provides an estimated monthly cost based on your current usage.  
   This estimate reflects what your charges would be if you continue using Security Hub with the same accounts and AWS Regions after the trial ends.

2. In the Security Hub console, open the **Usage** page by navigating to **Settings** from the left-hand menu and selecting **Usage**.
