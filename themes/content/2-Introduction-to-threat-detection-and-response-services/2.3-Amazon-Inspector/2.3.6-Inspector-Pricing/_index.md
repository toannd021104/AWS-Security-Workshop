#### Inspector - Pricing

1. You can review estimated spending in the Amazon Inspector console, including aggregated organization-wide costs in the central Amazon Inspector administrator account. This allows you to understand and estimate the cost of using Amazon Inspector for automated and continuous vulnerability scans across EC2, Amazon ECR, and Lambda functions for your entire organization before transitioning to paid usage.

2. From Inspector, open the **Usage** page using the navigation menu on the left under **General Settings**.

3. Review the projected cost. The projected cost is calculated based on account usage over the last 30 days. If the account has been active with Inspector for fewer than 30 days, the costs are extrapolated to a 30-day estimate based on current usage.
