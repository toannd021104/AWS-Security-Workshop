# Threat Detection & Response Workshop

### Overall

This workshop provides an introductory overview and then progresses into deeper exploration of AWS threat detection and response services, including common use cases, best practices, and practical scenarios. It begins with an introduction to the relevant services and then moves into advanced topics, with modules that focus on multi-service solutions, integrations, custom orchestration examples, and responses to specific detections. The overall goal is to help you build the knowledge and skills required to operate more securely on AWS.
