AWS Security Hub can aggregate security finding data from multiple AWS services as well as supported AWS Partner Network (APN) security solutions. This aggregation provides a comprehensive view of security and compliance across your AWS environment.

You can also configure Security Hub to receive findings generated by your own custom security products.

From supported AWS and partner product integrations, Security Hub ingests and consolidates only findings that are generated after Security Hub is enabled in your AWS accounts. Findings created before Security Hub is enabled are not retroactively collected.

One of the available partner integrations is Cloud Custodian. Cloud Custodian allows you to manage cloud resources by filtering, tagging, and applying actions based on defined policies. It uses a YAML-based DSL to define rules that help maintain a secure, well-managed, and cost-optimized cloud environment. For more information, visit https://cloudcustodian.io/

#### Receive findings from Cloud Custodian

1. Open the **Integrations** page in Security Hub and search for **Cloud Custodian**.

2. Click **Accept Findings** and review the permissions required for this integration.

3. Click **Accept findings**. This creates a service policy that allows the partner solution to send finding data to this account. For this workshop, a Cloud Custodian instance is already configured to automatically send findings to the integration you just enabled. For other partner integrations, you would still need to complete the configuration steps within the partner solution to ensure findings are sent to Security Hub.

You can click **See findings** to view new findings from Cloud Custodian. It may take 5–10 minutes for findings to appear.
