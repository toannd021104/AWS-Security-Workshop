	"content": "Security Hub automatically collects and consolidates findings from AWS security services enabled in your environment, such as intrusion detection findings from Amazon GuardDuty, vulnerability scan results from Amazon Inspector, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket policy findings from Amazon Macie, publicly accessible and cross-account resource findings from IAM Access Analyzer, and resources without WAF coverage identified by AWS Firewall Manager.\nThis aggregation provides a unified view of security and compliance across your AWS environment. AWS Security Hub brings together security findings from dozens of AWS security services and APN products into a single location and standardized format known as the AWS Security Finding Format (ASFF). Security Hub does not retroactively ingest findings that were generated before it was enabled. All findings are retained in Security Hub for 90 days from their last update.\nThe Integrations page in the AWS Management Console provides access to all available AWS and third-party product integrations. The AWS Security Hub API also includes operations for managing integrations. For AWS services, integrations are enabled automatically, and you can optionally disable individual integrations if needed.\nCentralizing findings from AWS security services   Navigate to Security Hub and open the Summary page. The Security Hub Summary page provides an overview of the security and compliance status of your AWS account.\n  Spend a few minutes reviewing the insights displayed on the Summary page. Can you identify the most common threat types detected in your environment? These findings are aggregated into Security Hub from Amazon GuardDuty.\n  Open the Integrations page in Security Hub and scroll through the available integrations.  As shown, many integrations, including Amazon: GuardDuty and Amazon: Inspector, are automatically enabled. However, each service must also be enabled independently to generate findings.\nSecurity Hub allows you to enable or disable AWS integrations. Although this is not typically recommended, try disabling the AWS: Firewall Manager integration by clicking Stop accepting findings in the AWS: Firewall Manager integration box.  A confirmation popup appears stating that Security Hub will no longer ingest findings from this integration, even though the product may continue sending them. Click Cancel to keep the integration enabled.   To view findings from a specific service, locate the Amazon: GuardDuty integration and click See findings. This opens the Findings page with a filter applied to display only GuardDuty findings.

	"content": "Detective - Overview Amazon Detective helps you analyze, investigate, and quickly identify the root cause of potential security issues or suspicious activity. It automatically collects log data from AWS resources and applies machine learning, statistical analysis, and graph theory to build a connected data set that supports faster and more efficient security investigations.\nAmazon Detective streamlines the investigation process and enables security teams to work more effectively. Prebuilt data aggregations, summaries, and contextual insights help you quickly assess the scope and nature of potential security issues. Amazon Detective retains up to one year of aggregated data and presents it through visualizations that show changes in activity type and volume over a selected time range, while linking those changes to security findings. There are no upfront costs, and you pay only for the events analyzed, with no additional software deployment or log configuration required.\nAmazon Detective extracts time-based events such as login attempts, API calls, and network traffic from AWS CloudTrail, Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) Flow Logs, Amazon GuardDuty findings, AWS Security Hub findings, and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) audit logs. Using this data, Detective builds a behavior graph that leverages machine learning to provide a unified, interactive view of resource behavior and interactions over time. By exploring the behavior graph, you can analyze security events such as failed login attempts, suspicious API calls, or related finding groups to support root cause investigation of AWS security findings.\nThreat actors often perform a sequence of actions when attempting to compromise an AWS environment, which can generate multiple security findings across different resources. Finding groups are collections of related security findings and resources that represent a single potential security incident and should be investigated together. Finding groups help reduce triage time by allowing you to investigate related findings as a whole rather than individually. You can begin investigations using finding groups to gain a more complete understanding of an incident. Interactive visualizations are also available, allowing you to explore specific findings and insights, including generative AI summaries that describe the sequence of events in natural language.\n"

	"content": "GuardDuty - Overview Amazon GuardDuty is a managed threat detection service that continuously analyzes activity across your AWS environment to identify malicious behavior and unauthorized actions. The service leverages a combination of machine learning (ML), statistical anomaly detection, and threat intelligence from AWS and trusted third-party sources to help protect AWS accounts, workloads, and data.\nGuardDuty is designed to operate at scale, analyzing tens of billions of events per day from multiple AWS data sources. These sources include AWS CloudTrail logs, Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Flow Logs, and DNS query logs. In addition, GuardDuty extends its monitoring capabilities to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) data events, Amazon Aurora database login activity, and runtime activity from compute and container services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), AWS Fargate, and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).\nOne of the core strengths of GuardDuty is its ability to detect signs of account compromise that are difficult to identify through manual or periodic inspection. Examples include access to AWS resources from unusual geographic locations, activity occurring at atypical times, or anomalous API behavior. For programmatic access, GuardDuty can identify suspicious API calls, such as attempts to disable CloudTrail logging to conceal activity or unauthorized snapshot creation originating from known malicious IP addresses.\nGuardDuty continuously evaluates account-level and workload-level events without requiring any additional software installation or infrastructure management. Foundational protections are enabled natively by analyzing existing AWS log sources. When multiple AWS accounts are associated, GuardDuty enables centralized threat detection, allowing findings to be aggregated and reviewed across accounts rather than managed individually.\nBy removing the need to manually collect, correlate, and analyze large volumes of security telemetry, GuardDuty allows security teams to focus on timely investigation and response, improve overall security posture, and continue scaling their workloads securely on AWS.\n"

	"content": "Inspector Amazon Inspector is a continuous vulnerability management service designed to scan AWS workloads for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure. With minimal setup through the AWS Management Console, the service can be enabled across all accounts within an AWS Organization. Once activated, Inspector automatically discovers supported resources at scale, including Amazon EC2 instances, container images stored in Amazon ECR and used within CI/CD pipelines, as well as AWS Lambda functions, and immediately begins assessing them against known vulnerability databases.\nFor each identified issue, Amazon Inspector calculates a contextual risk score by correlating Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) information with environmental factors such as network accessibility and exploitability. These scores help security teams prioritize remediation by focusing first on the vulnerabilities that pose the highest risk. All findings are aggregated and presented in the Amazon Inspector console and are automatically forwarded to AWS Security Hub and Amazon EventBridge to support centralized visibility and workflow automation. In addition, vulnerabilities detected in container images are reported directly to Amazon ECR, enabling resource owners to review and remediate issues within their existing operational workflows. Through this approach, Amazon Inspector enables organizations of all sizes to maintain consistent workload security and compliance across their AWS environments.\n"

	"content": "With cross-Region aggregation, you can collect findings, finding updates, insights, control compliance statuses, and security scores from multiple Regions into a single aggregation Region. All aggregated data can then be managed centrally from that aggregation Region.\nFor example, if you configure US East (N. Virginia) as the aggregation Region and US West (Oregon) and US West (N. California) as linked Regions, the Findings page in US East (N. Virginia) will display findings from all three Regions. Updates to findings are reflected across all Regions. Control enablement must still be managed per Region. If a control is enabled in a linked Region but disabled in the aggregation Region, you can view its compliance status from the aggregation Region, but you cannot enable or disable that control there.\nSet up cross-region finding aggregation   You may have already seen a prompt to Configure finding aggregation. You can select any of these prompts to begin the setup. If you did not see the prompt, open the Regions page under Settings from the navigation menu on the left.\n  Click Configure finding aggregation.\n   Select US East (N. Virginia) - us-east-1 as the aggregation Region.\n  Select all available Regions.\n  Click Save at the bottom of the page. This enables cross-region aggregation of findings but does not enable Security Hub in the other Regions.\n  Note to Participants: When you click Save to enable cross-region aggregation, aggregated scores and control data in Security Hub are reset. Findings are not removed and continue to be generated, but scores will not appear (for example, on the Summary page) until new scores are calculated across multiple Regions. You may want to complete the workshop section titled Security Posture Management before completing this module.\nTurn on the AWS security services you use in the linked Region Although many AWS security services are already enabled in us-east-1 (N. Virginia) and finding aggregation has been configured in Security Hub, this does not automatically enable those services in other Regions. To quickly enable the same AWS security services in us-east-2 (Ohio), use CloudFormation to deploy the required resources in the second Region. Once enabled, findings from those services are automatically aggregated into Security Hub in us-east-1 (N. Virginia) based on the configuration completed earlier.\nOpen the following page in the CloudFormation console:\nhttps://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/?filteringText=cfn\u0026amp;filteringStatus=active\u0026amp;viewNested=false  Click the stack named cfn.  Open the Outputs tab.   Select SecurityServicesCloudFormationLink to launch a preconfigured CloudFormation template in us-east-2 (Ohio). This opens the Quick create stack page in us-east-2 (Ohio) with stack details and parameters pre-filled. Confirm that the Region shown in the top-right corner is Ohio.\n  Leave the default values for Stack name, MyAssetsBucketName, and MyAssetsBucketPrefix. If these values are not populated, ask your facilitator.\n   At the bottom of the page, select the checkboxes acknowledging that AWS CloudFormation may create IAM resources with custom names and may require the capability CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND.\n  Click Create stack. This enables AWS Config, Security Hub, Inspector, Detective, Macie, and GuardDuty in us-east-2 (Ohio). Because cross-region aggregation is already configured, findings generated in this Region will automatically appear in the aggregation Region. This process may take a few minutes, and you can continue without waiting.\n   Return to Security Hub. If you are not already in the original workshop Region, a prompt to Go to aggregation region appears. Select it and confirm that you are back in us-east-1 (N. Virginia), indicated by N. Virginia in the top-right corner.\n  After returning to Security Hub in the aggregation Region, the Findings page now includes findings from multiple Regions, and the Summary page visualizations reflect cross-region data. These views will be explored further later in the workshop.\n  (After 5 minute)\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": "Amazon Detective finding groups allow you to examine multiple activities in the context of a potential security event. Finding groups help you analyze the root cause of high-severity GuardDuty findings by bringing together related security signals. When a threat actor attempts to compromise an AWS environment, they typically perform a sequence of actions that generate multiple security findings and unusual behaviors. These actions are often distributed across different points in time and across multiple entities. Investigating findings in isolation can lead to misinterpretation of their importance and make it more difficult to identify the root cause. Amazon Detective addresses this challenge by using graph analysis techniques to infer relationships between findings and entities and grouping them together. Finding groups are recommended as the starting point for investigating related entities and findings.\nDetective analyzes finding data and groups findings that are likely related based on shared resources. For example, findings associated with actions performed by the same IAM role session or originating from the same IP address are often part of the same underlying activity. Reviewing findings and evidence as a group provides additional context, even when some associations identified by Detective may not be directly related.\nIn addition to findings, each finding group includes the entities involved in those findings. These entities can include AWS resources as well as external entities such as IP addresses or user agents.\nWhen an initial GuardDuty finding occurs that is related to another finding, Amazon Detective creates a finding group containing all related findings and associated entities within 48 hours.\n"

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "GuardDuty retains the generated findings for a period of 90 days. GuardDuty exports the active findings to Amazon EventBridge. You can optionally export the generated findings to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. This will help you to track the historical data of potentially suspicious activities in your account and evaluate whether the recommended remediation steps were successful.\nAny new active findings that GuardDuty generates are automatically exported within about 5 minutes after the finding is generated. You can set the frequency for how often updates to the active findings are exported to EventBridge. The frequency that you select applies to the exporting of new occurrences of existing findings to EventBridge, your S3 bucket (when configured), and Detective (when integrated).\nWhen you configure settings to export findings to an Amazon S3 bucket, GuardDuty uses AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt the findings data in your S3 bucket. This requires you to add permissions to your S3 bucket and the AWS KMS key so that GuardDuty can use them to export findings in your account.\n"
