{{%notice info%}}
**Scenario / Problem Statement**: Your team has noticed a growing number of security findings from Amazon Inspector. Your team turned on Inspector to continually scan Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), AWS Lambda functions, and container images in Amazon ECR for software vulnerabilities. However, based on the number of findings, it doesn't appear anyone is managing those vulnerabilities. You've been tasked with defining and setting up patch management for your EC2 instances, starting with those being used for development.

Amazon Inspector is a vulnerability management service that continuously scans your AWS workloads for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure. Amazon Inspector automatically discovers and scans running Amazon EC2 instances, container images in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR), and AWS Lambda functions for known software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure.

Amazon Inspector creates a finding when it discovers a software vulnerability or network configuration issue. A finding describes the vulnerability, identifies the affected resource, rates the severity of the vulnerability, and provides remediation guidance. You can analyze findings using the Amazon Inspector console, or view and process your findings through other AWS services.

Patch Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, automates the process of patching managed nodes with both security-related updates and other types of updates. You can use Patch Manager to apply patches for both operating systems and applications. (On Windows Server, application support is limited to updates for applications released by Microsoft.) You can use Patch Manager to install Service Packs on Windows nodes and perform minor version upgrades on Linux nodes. You can patch fleets of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, edge devices, on-premises servers, and virtual machines (VMs) by operating system type.

You can scan instances to see only a report of missing patches, or you can scan and automatically install all missing patches.

Patch Manager uses patch baselines, which include rules for auto-approving patches within days of their release, in addition to optional lists of approved and rejected patches. When a patching operation runs, Patch Manager compares the patches currently applied to a managed node to those that should be applied according to the rules set up in the patch baseline. You can choose for Patch Manager to show you only a report of missing patches (a Scan operation), or you can choose for Patch Manager to automatically install all patches it finds are missing from a managed node (a Scan and install operation).

In this section you will:

- Define patch baseline
- Scan your instances with AWS-RunPatchBaseline via Run Command
- Review patch compliance for managed nodes
- Install missing patches using Run Command
- Schedule patch operations using patch policies
- Review association created by the patch policy

#### Define patch baseline
6. Navigate to Systems Manager and open Patch Manager from the navigation on the left. https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/patch-manager?region=us-east-1

#### Scan your instances with AWS-RunPatchBaseline via Run Command
Using Run Command, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, you can remotely and securely manage the configuration of your managed nodes. A managed node is any Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance or non-EC2 machine in your hybrid and multi-cloud environment that has been configured for Systems Manager. Run Command allows you to automate common administrative tasks and perform one-time configuration changes at scale.

AWS Systems Manager supports AWS-RunPatchBaseline, a Systems Manager document (SSM document) for Patch Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager. This SSM document performs patching operations on managed nodes for both security related and other types of updates. When the document is run, it uses the patch baseline specified as the "default" for an operating system type if no patch group is specified. Otherwise, it uses the patch baseline that is associated with the patch group.

{{%notice tip%}}
You can learn more about the AWS-RunPatchBaseline SSM document under the Documents section of Systems Manager or in the documentation here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/patch-manager-aws-runpatchbaseline.html

<!-- #### Schedule patch operations using patch policies
A patch policy is a configuration you set up using Quick Setup, a capability of AWS Systems Manager. Patch policies provide more extensive and more centralized control over your patching operations than is available with other methods of configuring patching. A patch policy defines the schedule and baseline to use when automatically patching your nodes and applications.

Instead of using other methods of patching your nodes, use a patch policy to take advantage of these major features:

- Single setup – Setting up patching operations using a maintenance window or State Manager association can require multiple tasks in different parts of the Systems Manager console. Using a patch policy, all your patching operations can be set up in a single wizard.
- Multi-account/Multi-Region support – Using a maintenance window, a State Manager association, or the Patch now feature in Patch Manager, you're limited to targeting managed nodes in a single AWS account-AWS Region pair. If you use multiple accounts and multiple Regions, your setup and maintenance tasks can require a great deal of time, because you must perform setup tasks in each account-Region pair. However, if you use AWS Organizations, you can set up one patch policy that applies to all your managed nodes in all AWS Regions in all your AWS accounts. Or, if you choose, a patch policy can apply to only some organizational units (OUs) in the accounts and Regions you choose. A patch policy can also apply to a single local account, if you choose.
- Installation support at the organizational level – The existing Host Management configuration option in Quick Setup provides support for a daily scan of your managed nodes for patch compliance. However, this scan is done at a predetermined time and results in patch compliance information only. No patch installations are performed. Using a patch policy, you can specify different schedules for scanning and installing. You can also choose the frequency and time of these operations by using custom CRON or Rate expressions. For example, you could scan for missing patches every day to provide you with regularly updated compliance information. Your installation schedule could be just once a week to avoid unwanted downtime.
- Simplified patch baseline selection – Patch policies still incorporate patch baselines, and there are no changes to the way patch baselines are configured. However, when you create or update a patch policy, you can select the AWS managed or custom baseline you want to use for each operating system (OS) type in a single list. It’s not necessary to specify the default baseline for each OS type in separate tasks.
