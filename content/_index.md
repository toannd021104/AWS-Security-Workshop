# AWS Security Monitoring and Investigation Workshop

### Overall

This workshop focuses on how to monitor, analyze, and investigate security events in AWS environments using native AWS security services. Participants will learn how security findings are generated, aggregated, correlated, and investigated across accounts and regions.

The workshop starts with an introduction to core AWS security monitoring services, followed by hands-on modules covering centralized visibility, service integrations, security investigations, and automated workflows. The objective is to help you understand how to operate and maintain effective security visibility and investigation capabilities at scale on AWS.
