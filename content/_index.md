# Threat Detection & Response Workshop

### Overall
This workshop is designed to give you an introduction and then take you deeper into AWS threat detection and response services use cases, best practices, and specific scenarios. This workshop starts with an introduction to services and then focuses on advanced topics of threat detection and response with modules focusing on multi-service solutions, integrations, custom orchestration examples, and examples of responding to specific detections. All of this is designed to prepare you and help you operate more securely on AWS.

 Most of this workshop is created from AWS workshop's accounts (including setting up many EC2 instances), except section 5.3, where you can dive deep in the "Automated Security Response" AWS Solution with me. You can do this workshop by register to AWS Activation Day "Threat Detection & Response" at https://awsactivationdays.splashthat.com/.
