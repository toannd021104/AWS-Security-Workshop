A GuardDuty finding represents a potential security issue detected within your network. GuardDuty generates a finding whenever it detects unexpected and potentially malicious activity in your AWS environment. You can view and manage your GuardDuty findings on the Findings page in the GuardDuty console or by using the GuardDuty CLI or API operations.
